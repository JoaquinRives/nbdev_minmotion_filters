Abstract
----------
We present a novel method for estimating respiratory motion using inertial measurement
units (IMUs) based on microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology. As an application of
the method we consider the amplitude gating of positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, and
compare the method against a clinically used respiration motion estimation technique. The presented
method can be used to detect respiratory cycles and estimate their lengths with state-of-the-art
accuracy when compared to other IMU-based methods, and is the first based on commercial MEMS
devices, which can estimate quantitatively both the magnitude and the phase of respiratory motion
from the abdomen and chest regions. For the considered test group consisting of eight subjects
with acute myocardial infarction, our method achieved the absolute breathing rate error per minute
of 0.44 ± 0.23 1/min, and the absolute amplitude error of 0.24 ± 0.09 cm, when compared to the
clinically used respiratory motion estimation technique. The presented method could be used to
simplify the logistics related to respiratory motion estimation in PET imaging studies, and also to
enable multi-position motion measurements for advanced organ motion estimation.
